# git-subrepos

Alternative implementation to git submodules written in Go

## Motivation

I was working on a project with lots of git submodules,
and maintaining those submodules up-to-date was an awful task :)

I've decided to create this project to experiment with the idea
of treating our dependencies like a regular git repository,
and not like a git submodule anymore.

This repository is on its very first days,
so expecte an update on the source code and this read-me file.

I'm not very experienced with go,
so it's also one of my first projects using the language.

In other words, this is an experiment and an opportunity to learn.
